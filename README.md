# Maze-Gen-Astar-Solve
--------------------------
Maze generation using a backtracking algorithm implemented with a stack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
Then solving the generated maze using A* shortest path algorihtm implemented with a priority queue. Euclidean distance as the heuristic.

This is drawn in a canvas object with simple animation.

The algorithm and animation work, I had plans to provide the ability to increase speed of the animation.
